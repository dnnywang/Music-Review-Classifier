# Music-Review-Classifier

A classifier that determines whether a music review is associated with a positive (numeric score of 8.5 to 10), a mostly positive (5.5 to 8.5) or negative (0 to 5.5) score.

This classifier uses data from Nolan Conaway's 18393 Pitchfork Reviews (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data).

This project involved getting comfortable using SKLearn to train a classifier on a dataset organized using Pandas. Sqlite3 and SQL was also used to process the initial data (.sqlite) into Python. There is also a brief use of nltk to assist in some text processing.
